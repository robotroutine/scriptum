# No-frills Functional Programming Lib Augmenting Javascript/Node.js

with a focus on arrays, (async) iterators, streams, string processing and regular expressions.

Status: no more major revisions expected but still unstable in some hideous details..

Author: Iven Marquardt

Scriptum's focus is a consequence of being the foundation of a more elaborate natural language processing lib that covers the following aspects:

* natural language tokenization (sentences and words)
* evaluated diffing (evaluated differences between two words)
* typo/spelling tolerance (takes typos and alternative spellings into account)

The NLP lib isn't disclosed on Github for the time being.
