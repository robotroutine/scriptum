# No-frills Functional Programming Lib Augmenting Javascript/Node.js

with a focus on arrays, (async) iterators, streams, string processing and regular expressions.

Status: no more major revisions expected but still unstable in some hideous details..

Author: Iven Marquardt

Scriptum's focus is a consequence of being the foundation of a more elaborate natural language processing lib that covers the following aspects:

* natural language tokenization (sentences/words)
* abbreviation recognition
* word frequency, dispersion, and co-occurrence
* spelling tolerance (take typos and alternative spellings into account)
* word stemming
* evaluating word diffing
* sentence equivalence
* semantic category mapping
* associative maps

The NLP lib isn't disclosed on Github for the time being.
